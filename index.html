			   <h3>Technological Empathy &#38; Stoopid Computers</h3>
	  		   	  <p>Technological Empathy is having an understanding for how a specific or suite of related technologies 
                    <em>work &#38; function</em>.It could be in the form of mechanical empathy that allows you to successfully 
                    rebuild a 1953 CHEVY (definitely not me); or, an empathy around the internet or computers (of which I possess slightly 
                    more, but not much) that allows you to understand and leverage your understanding to make a computer perform the tasks 
                    you wish.  Part of technological empathy around computers is understanding that they are stoopid.&#32;&#32; However, I
                    tend to think that they are more 'imaginationally challenged', then stupid.  So, a computer, unlike my youngest daughter, 
                    will do exactly what you tell it to do and in the proscribed time, manner, and method.  Sort of like my oldest daugther when 
                    she wants to push my buttons. For example, I am <b><em>really</em> liking this class and want to really emphasize 'really'.  
                    However, if I end the italics, but forget to te</b>ll it to stop bolding the text (Oops!), it will keep on doing what I told 
                    it do or not do what I didn't tell it.</p>
 			  </div>
              <div class="topic" id="internet">
                   <h3>The Internet</h3>
                      <p>To me, the internet comprises both the information/data that is  primarily contained, referenced, and linked through HTML docs
					   and the channels through which we access the information, i.e. what connects our commputers, devices, household appliances, etc. 
					    However, one day, I do hope to be able to better grasp the 'cloud'.</p>
			  </div>
			  <div class="topic" id="HTML">
                <h3>HTML</h3>
                    <p><b class="subhead">HTML:</b><br>
					Hypertext Markup Language is the backbone of the content on the web.  When you view a 'web' page through your 
                    browser, the browser is rendering the HTML in a manner that is visually accommodating to people, and hopefully, in an attractive and 
                    organized manner.  The hypertext is the content and the 'markup' tells the browser how to organize and display the information.
					</p>

			  <p><b class="subhead">HTML Tags:</b><br>
                &#60;tags&#62; comprise the basic grammar and syntax of HTML.  There are opening &#60;tags&#62; and closing &#60;/tags&#62; that will act 
				to organize and display content in specific manners; and, everything between the opening and closing tag is called an <b>element</b>.  Most, but not all, &#60;tags&#62; will have a closing tag.  A few tags such as &#60;br&#62; or &#60;img&#62;do not have closing tags, and are called 'void' tags.<br>
                <br>
				<b class="subhead">Innline vs Block Tags:</b>
				<br>Another distinction between tags is whether or not they are considered to 'inline' or 'block' tags.  Inline and block tags 
				organize the white space within a document in different ways.  A block tag imparts a dimensionality to the element that is 
				interpreted as a box or block, whereas an inline, according to the 
				<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Inline_elemente" style="text-decoration: none;">Mozilla 
				Development Network</a>: "An inline element occupies only the space bounded by the tags that define the inline element." 
				Examples of inline tag is the &#60;br&#62;<br> that wraps the text. And the &#60;span&#62; tag <span class="dif_text">that 
				may be used to alternatively style a block of text.</span>
                <br><br>An example of a block tag is the &#60;p&#62; or paragraph tag.

				<br><br><b class="subhead">Attributes:</b><a href="http://techland.time.com/2012/08/03/trs-80/">
				<img class="trs_80" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/TRS-80_Model_III.jpg" alt="TRS 80 Computer"></a>
                <br> Elements may have attributes; and, attributes will have 'values' that may modify the element.  
				Some elements are required to have attributes like &#60;img&#62; and &#60;a&#62;. So, in order to show the image 
				of, and provide a link to a tribute article to the very first computer I ever used (the TRS-80), I would need to use the attributes of 'href' to provide the link and 'src' to provide the path to the image.	(Image: Wiki Commons).

		  <h2 > Lesson 2: Basics of the HTML Structure</h2>
	 	  	 <div class="topic" id="structure">  
			   <h3>Structure of a Web Page</h3>
	  		   	  <p>A web page is put together, in general, with <b>HTML</b>, which provides the structure and foundation of the the page;
				  <b>CSS</b>, which provides the style; and <b>JavaScript</b>, which will 'fancify' your web page by allowing
				  certin functionallity. A useful way to understand a web page's coding and organization is to 'boxify' the layout by visualizing or
				  drawing boxes around the major content compononents.  Each box will represent a different section and that leads us to using the 'div'
				  tag, which is the basic tag used to define the boxes/structure in a page.
 			  </div>
              <div class="topic" id="DOM">
                   <h3>Document Object Model (DOM)</h3>
                      <p>The 'DOM' ( da DOM DOM) represents the structure of the html and has a tree like structure tht shows the hierarchal relations
					  of the elements within a page.  The DOM can either be built manually or you can be smart and view it in developer tools. The DOM 
					  shows the relationship of the structural components and how
					  different components or elements are nested within the boxes; and also how different boxes or 'divs' are nested within other boxes.
					  </p>
			  </div>
			  <div class="topic" id="tools">
                <h3>Tools for the Front-end Developer</h3>
                    <p>Two tools are <b>HTML Editors</b> and the <b>Developer Tools</b> within a browser. HTML editors are specically designed
					to help write copy and will have features that will help minimize the repetivie nature of having to type the same thing over and
					over again.  For example, I generally use the CoffeCup Editor.  The other really useful tool is the 'Developer Tools' feature within
					the browser.  The developer tools not only allow you to see the html, but alsow to view the style, the box dimensions, and very importantly,
					allow you to alter tags and elements to see what the result would be.  The developer tool also provides you with the DOM. Other useful
					tools include <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b> code validators.  These are awesome in that they will allow you more easily trouble-shoot any mistakes
					that you have made in your code.

 <div class="lesson" id="lesson_3">
		  <h2 > Lesson 3: Basics of Style and CSS</h2>
	 	  	 <div class="topic">  
			   <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
	  		   	  <p><b>CSS</b> is short for Cascading Style Sheets.  CSS allows you to impart style or 'purtify' your web page. 'Cascading'
				  means that CSS rules follow rules of inheritance in that descendant elements will inherit the style properties of the ancestors
				  unles established otherwise. Within CSS, the most specific rule is applied across the document.  For example, if I say that all'p'
				  elements will have a blue font color, all 'p' elements will have a blue font-color, unless I more specfically provide a class or id
				  value to a 'p' element and have set it up for that class or id to produce a red font.
				  </p>
 			  </div>
              <div class="topic" id="css_applied">
                   <h3>How May CSS Be Applied</h3>
                      <p>CSS may be applied in one of three ways:</p>
					  	 <ol class="normal">
						 	 <li> Inline to an element although, this should be avoided at all costs it requires repeqting code.  With the notable except of writing
							 HTML emails.  This is a whole 'nother class, though...</li>
							 <li> Within the HTML document 'head' section within 'style' tags.  Again, avoid this for web-pages as you want 
							 to <b>SEPARATE YOUR CONCERNS</b></li>
							 <li>Within a linked style sheet.  The recommended and web-page approved manner.</li>
						</ol>
						 <p> One of the biggest advantages of using CSS is that it allows you avoid having to repeat the same instructions
						  for like elements.
			  </div>
			  <div class="topic" id="box_model">
                <h3>Box Model</h3>
                    <p>When understanding style for web-pages, it is important to grasp the concept of the 'Box Model'.
					The Box Model simply delineates the dimensions and components of a box. </p>
					<p>The dimensions of a box are determined by the:</p>
					<ol class="normal">
						<li> The margin which defines the 'whitespace' outside of a box.  Although the margin is not used in the
						calculation.</li>
						<li>The border or the edge around the box.</li>
						<li>The padding within the box, or the 'buffer' space around the conent within a box.</li>
						<li>The content width and height within the box.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>Now this can be all very confusing when trying to figure and determine boxes.  So there a couple of things
					that you can do to make your life easier when formatting the boxes:</p>
					<ol class="normal">
						<li> Set sizes of the box in terms of percentages, e.g. 70%.</li>
						<li> Set box-sizing attribute to border-box across all the elements </li>
					</ol>
					<p>A key skill would need to be learning how to position your boxes.  For example, lets say
					I  wanted to have two boxes in my document.  By default, Box 1 would stack on top of Box 2</p>
					   <div>
					     <div class="box_1">
					   	 <p>Box 1</p>
						 </div>
						 <div class="box_2">
						 <p> BOX 2</p>
						 </div>
						</div>

						<p>However, if I want them to be side-by-by side, I would need to use an atrribut and value (display: flex)
						that would allow the boxes to position themselves side by side.
						<div class="side">
						<div class="box_1">
					   	 <p>Box 1</p>
						 </div>
						 <div class="box_2">
						 <p> BOX 2</p>
						 </div>
					</div>
